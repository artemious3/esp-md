# ESP32 Metal Detector

*Warning: work in progress*

This is an adaptation of (Minimal Arduino Metal Detector)[https://www.instructables.com/Minimal-Arduino-Metal-Detector/]
for ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller. 
Since it's fastest timer is 40MHz (vs Arduino's 16MHz), this detector should be more sensitive.
